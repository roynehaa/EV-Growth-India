          <h2>The Semiconductor Industry: Market Structure</h2>
          <p>
            The semiconductor industry is highly competitive, innovation-driven,
            and continuously growing but is subject to rapid changes and
            volatility. Also, the semiconductor industry is recognised as a
            critical driver and constantly adds value to the electronics sector.
            The structure is based on the foundry model, mainly consisting of
            semiconductor fabrication plants (foundries) where devices such as
            integrated circuits are made. The competitive environment requires
            technological upgrades, significant capital requirements, and
            investment in research and development for scalability.

        <section id="applications">
          <h2>Applications</h2>
          <p>
            Components developed by the semiconductor industry are used in
            various products, viz. smartphones, PCs, IoT devices, and data
            centres. Besides that, the demand for automotive semiconductors is
            projected to grow, with cars getting more intelligent and more
            connected as days pass by.

          <h2>How do semiconductors drive the growth of EVs?</h2>
          <p>
            We've seen a long, growing checklist that reflects the users’
            preferences and concerns. However, to make this a reality, the pace
            of innovation in the automotive industry should accelerate. For the
            automotive industry, this is only possible by sharing relevant data
            and frequently collaborating with the semiconductor industry. The
            average car is packed with 1,400 semiconductors that control
            everything from airbags to the engine. Modern vehicles simply cannot
            run without chips.
          </p>
          <img src="cara.png" alt="Electric Car" width="95%" height="30%" />

          <p>
            EVs use high voltage batteries, which require accurate cell
            monitoring to ensure smooth performance during long rides. Although
            the daily commute is less than 50 km for most users, having battery
            monitors and balancers enables accurate tracking to provide more
            efficient battery use, leading to longer runtime and reduced battery
            size and cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is essential to improve a vehicle’s stability and limit the
            traction between tires and the road in various conditions. This is
            achieved by using a proper electronic stability program and traction
            inverter system, which allows the driver to maintain ideal motor
            torque while improving overall efficiency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS): Automakers create a
            safer, collision-free future by integrating automation into the
            vehicle's core. Using highly accurate radar SoCs, powerful
            processors, high-resolution cameras, and power management products
            enables automakers to build high-performance ADAS.
          </p>

          <p>
            Almost all new vehicles feature wireless devices to offer seamless
            connectivity across devices and premium audio systems to provide the
            best sound and user experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Functional safety standards have improved the driving experience
            with advanced safety features, reliability and better performance.
            Active safety is critical in every system. The semiconductor
            industry effectively creates a safer driving experience using a wide
            range of integrated systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Faster Charging: As EVs move towards faster, high-voltage charging
            technologies, they need sophisticated power topologies with other
            microcontrollers to enable quick and efficient charging. Moreover,
            wireless battery management systems remove the need for bulky wiring
            while improving driving range, performance and overall maintenance.

        <section id="global-shortage">
          <h2>The Global Semiconductor Shortage</h2>
          <p>
            The ongoing semiconductor shortage damaged the global automotive
            industry, costing about $200 billion in revenue and an estimated
            production loss of 7.7 million vehicles. The imbalance in the supply
            chain was mainly caused due to the following reasons:
          </p>

          <p>
            COVID-19: Working from home during the pandemic led to a steep
            increase in the demand for electronics. Home networking gear,
            webcams, and monitors were set up at home for a work office
            environment. Chips used in the automobile industry needed less
            computing power, giving the manufacturers an incentive to build more
            sophisticated and expensive chips, shifting their attention away
            from legacy chips used in automobiles. Simultaneously, the pandemic
            instigated demand for private transport vehicles, driving people
            away from public modes of transport - creating a supply-demand
            imbalance in the industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Automobiles Sales Hike: Automakers who cut back drastically early in
            the pandemic underestimated how quickly car sales would rebound once
            the lockdown was lifted. There was a sudden increase in the demand
            for semiconductor chips by the automobile companies to meet the car
            sales demand. However, semiconductor manufacturers could not meet
            the needs because their attention was diverted, and they had already
            started supplying the electronics sector with faster chips.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stockpiling: PC makers had warned about semiconductor shortage by
            2020. Huawei, a Chinese smartphone maker that also dominates the
            global market for 5G networking gear, began hoarding chips to ensure
            it could survive US sanctions that were set to cut it off from its
            primary suppliers (China-US trade war). Soon, other companies
            followed suit, leading to an increase in China's chip import from
            $330 billion in 2019 to $380 billion in 2020.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adverse Weather: A severe winter storm in February 2021 forced the
            closure of two plants in Austin, Texas, owned by NXP Semiconductors
            and Samsung, causing a month-long delay in production. Also, TSMC
            experienced a shortage of ultra-pure water required for cleaning the
            machinery due to severe drought in the country.
          </p>

          <p>
            The US-China Trade War: The ongoing economic conflict between the
            world’s largest economies further fueled the semiconductor shortage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Occupational Disasters: On October 2020, a fire broke into an Asahi
            Kasei semiconductor plant in Miyazaki, Japan (specialising in ADC
            and DAC components). Another Japanese factory owned by Renesas
            Electronics caught fire in March 2021; the company is responsible
            for 30 per cent of the total global market for microcontrollers for
            cars.

          <h2>The US-China Trade War</h2>
          <p>
            The ever-rising bilateral US trade deficit in goods with China and
            its inflexible exchange rates have been subject to criticism of the
            US government on multiple occasions. Alarmed by China’s large-scale
            economic policies, the Obama administration accused China of unfair
            trade practices, including exporting goods at dumping prices and
            subsidising aluminium and steel production, initiating a series of
            anti-dumping investigations against China. On top of that, the US
            government imposed tariffs on Chinese textiles to shield domestic
            producers. The trade relationship between the two countries weakened
            further when former US President Donald Trump formally launched his
            trade war against China in 2018.
          </p>

          <p>
            Economists don’t disregard the chances of an economic decoupling
            with rising tensions between the two nations, resulting in China
            losing access to American technology, capital, and markets. The
            United States and its allies are taking the necessary steps to align
            their motives and reduce reliance on Chinese goods.

            <p>
              For China, the costs of achieving self-sufficiency would be
              unsustainably high. A quarter of China’s food imports come from
              the US, and its efforts to reduce dependence has seemingly failed
              as the cost of replacing these items with domestic supplies will
              be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, China has dramatically
              underestimated the challenge of establishing a sanctions-proof
              chipmaking industry. The foundation of global technology supply
              chains is specialisation, and no single country or company can
              dominate or monopolise the entire supply chain. Due to multiple
              process mechanisms and requiring over 300 different inputs when
              making chips, even the US, the industry leader, cannot build a
              fully indigenous semiconductor supply chain. While China
              reportedly plans to spend $1.4 trillion over the next five years
              pursuing that goal, it is less likely to achieve fruition.

            The Indo-Pacific region spans two oceans and several continents,
            making it important to U.S. maritime interests. This year, 42 per
            cent of the world’s exports and 38 per cent of global imports are
            expected to pass through, according to a recent UN report. With the
            formation of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) consisting
            of the United States, India, Japan and Australia, strengthening its
            economic and security ties in the region, China is left with limited
            options to address its financial vulnerabilities.

          <h2>Response to the Semiconductor Shortage</h2>
          <p>
            The automobile industry has been hit the hardest due to the
            semiconductor shortage, and the supply-demand imbalance is still
            rising. Carmakers may have to take a step back from
            semiconductor-intensive solutions in the short run and make
            sacrifices in efficiency and sustainability to manufacture cars and
            meet the industry’s demands.
          </p>

          <p>
            The leading car makers have been deploying several strategies to
            tackle the shortage:
          </p>

          <p>
            BMW and Volkswagen have joined Tesla in protecting their car sales
            from the shortage by reconfiguring the supply chain by teaming up
            with semiconductor manufacturers to develop custom microcontrollers
            that can perform multiple functions. Some companies are building
            prototypes of EV cars without semiconductor-dependent features to
            launch vehicles quickly and meet the market demand.
          </p>

          <p>
            Toyota has been stockpiling chips for years to avoid a similar
            situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leading semiconductor companies like TSMC and Samsung have been
            building production facilities to ramp up production and tackle the
            imbalance. TSMC has announced an additional $100 billion investment
            plan over the next three years to increase capacity, while Intel has
            announced a $20 billion investment in Arizona for manufacturing two
            new fabrication plants. Samsung has committed $151 billion to
            expanding its advanced chip manufacturing and is expected to expand
            in the United States with a new $17 billion chip plant.

          <h2>India’s Response and Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Despite being able to create a cost-effective ecosystem, the Indian
            government currently lacks the speed of decisions it should make to
            compete in a competitive global market. Multiple companies have
            reported experiencing delays of several months for getting approval
            and NOCs to set up their plants in India.
          </p>
          <img src="chip.png" alt="Electric Car" width="95%" height="40%" />
          <p>
            The government has approved an INR 76,000 crore incentive scheme to
            promote semiconductor manufacturing and demonstration. Experts say
            this will be a strategic benefit for India, especially when facing a
            semiconductor shortage.
          </p>

          <p>
            This initiative will accelerate the development of a complete
            semiconductor ecosystem in design, manufacturing, packaging and
            testing.
          </p>
          <h2>More about the PLI scheme announced by GoI</h2>
          <p>The scheme designed to incentivise the sector is as follows:</p>
          <p>
            -Foundries or semiconductor fabrication units will be offered
            financial support of up to 30% to 50% of project cost based on node
            size being manufactured. Display fab units will be supported for up
            to 50% of project cost with a limit of 12,000 crores.<br />
            -Sensors, compound units and ATMP/OSAT facilities will be offered
            financial support of up to 30% of capital expenditure to approved
            units.<br />
            -Fabless entities will receive a design-linked incentive of up to
            50% of eligible expenditure (maximum INR 15 crores per application)
            and a product deployment-linked incentive of 4-6% on net sales for
            five years (up to INR 30 crores per application).<br />
            -The government also offers a clear twenty-year roadmap to
            generating highly skilled employment opportunities. It also
            established an "Indian Semiconductor Mission" to assess long term
            opportunities prevailing within the sector.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is worthy to note that the government has taken a double-edged
            approach to generate new sources of revenue through semiconductor
            production whilst consolidating its position as a paramount entity
            in chip design by offering design-linked incentives to promote
            research and development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Increasing domestic semiconductor production has a tremendous
            strategic advantage given that labour costs are low and production
            capacity is ample. This will help domestic companies reduce their
            dependence on semiconductor imports and help generate income through
            overseas exports and become more competitive in the global market.
            Currently, Tata Group, Intel, Foxconn from Taiwan, and other
            manufacturers have expressed interest in setting up manufacturing
            plants in India.

          <h2>Identifying the Value Drivers and Taking Action</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Labour & Process:</strong> Automakers and top-tier suppliers
            should gather and analyse more sophisticated data about the
            semiconductor value chain and where chips could be manufactured.
            Better decisions are made when business leaders can redefine the
            competitive landscape by weighing the technological applications for
            prioritisation at the level of the individual chips required.

            <p>
              <strong>Services, Resources, and Asset Utilisation:</strong> Using
              predictive maintenance and remote maintenance mechanisms can
              reduce maintenance costs. Flexible routing and predictive
              maintenance technologies will help minimise machine downtimes by
              as large as 50%. Intelligent IoTs can improve productivity rates
              considerably.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Supply-Demand Match:</strong> Data-driven demand
              prediction, open innovation, and optimisation algorithms will
              reduce inventory costs and ensure adequate supply to match demand.
              Manufacturers have complained of a lack of transparency regarding
              actual demand levels as automakers are ordering processors and
              other devices in excess. In the long term, the industry should
              rethink how supply contracts be structured.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            A consistent, balanced risk-sharing plan across the value chain can
            also help drive growth. All the stakeholders must align their
            business goals to ensure a better supply-demand match.
