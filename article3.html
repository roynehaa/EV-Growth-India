            <h2>The Indian EV Market</h2>
            <p>
              India's automotive industry is the fifth-largest globally and will
              become the third-largest by 2030. It is expected to reach $150
              billion by 2030. Global adoption of electric vehicles has
              increased significantly, with sales exceeding 2020 figures in the
              first half of 2021. A similar trend can be seen in India. India's
              automotive industry is the fifth-largest globally and will become
              the third-largest by 2030. It is expected to reach $150 billion by
              2030. The Indian electric vehicle market is currently in its
              infancy and is projected to reach a CAGR of 90% from 2021 to 2030.
              In terms of penetration, EV sales will only account for 1.3% of
              all automobile sales in India in 2021. The surge in demand for
              electric vehicles is mainly due to favourable regulatory
              frameworks and has attracted foreign investment. At present, many
              state governments in India have already started taking steps
              towards net-zero emission and sustainability in business. About
              ten states and union territories (UTs) are increasing the usage of
              electric vehicles in three areas: manufacturing, infrastructure,
              and services. Given India's role as part of the global automotive
              quartet (US, China, Japan), large-scale changes in the Indian
              market will affect the industry's global presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite India's ambitious goals, the electric vehicle market in
              India is still in its infancy. But looking the other way, India
              offers the world's largest untapped market, especially in the
              two-wheeler sector. This sector is 100% FDI accepted through
              automatic route. Electric two-wheelers continue to sell in large
              numbers; however, electric cars are experiencing a sluggish
              uptake, accounting for less than 1% of the country's total 2.5
              million passenger car sales. For example, the share of battery
              electric vehicles (BEVs) in all passenger cars sold in Europe was
              5.4% in FY2020, compared to just 0.2% in India. However, as the
              ecosystem improves, the share of electric vehicles is estimated to
              increase to 12% of all passenger cars by 2026, according to the
              JMK Research Report. Over the past few years, there have been
              considerable advancements in the industry and are now keeping up
              with other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the approach to becoming a marketing hub varies between
              states and UTs, the general trend suggests one central point: most
              states aim to become hubs for producing electric vehicles and
              their components. Environmentally friendly battery production,
              processing, and storage are stimulated everywhere. States
              governments of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have been taking the
              necessary steps to ensure such facilities' development.
            </p>
            <p>
              With natural resources and cheap labour, India is becoming one of
              the most prominent hotspots for manufacturing and exports.
              Currently, the growth in the Indian automotive market is driven by
              factors such as the increase in domestic manufacturing, rapid
              urbanisation, a booming economy and growing environmental
              concerns. Fueled by the ongoing US-China trade war, many global
              automakers have shown interest in India. Additionally, e-car sales
              in India have increased since 2019, increasing by 361.78%
              year-over-year in 2020. As of July 2021, the number of
              registrations has increased further, exceeding the sales volume in
              2020. It is estimated that about INR 940 billion (US$12.6 billion)
              will be invested in electric vehicle manufacturing in India over
              the next five years across the entire value chain.
            </p>
            <h3>Major EV players in the country</h3>
            <h4>TATA</h4>
            <p>
              Tata Motors has formed an electric vehicle subsidiary, Tata
              Passenger Electric Mobility Limited (TPEML), to manufacture
              electric and hybrid vehicles. TPEML will not own any manufacturing
              plants but acquire output and assets from passenger vehicle
              factories. TPEML plans to have ten products by FY26, catering to
              all drive ranges. TATA currently holds a 71 per cent share in the
              EV market. The company is clocking sales of more than 1,000 units
              of EVs every month. During FY21, the company had clocked revenues
              of ₹500- ₹600 crores in the EV business. An intelligent strategy
              with a clear focus on breaking the key EV barriers and
              partnerships with group companies such as Tata Power, Tata
              Chemicals for establishing the EV ecosystem, dubbed the TATA
              ‘uniEVerse', has paid dividends for the company.
            </p>

            <h4>Mahindra</h4>
            <div class="ev-container">
              <img src="mahindraimage.webp" height="30%" width="30%" />
              <p>
                Mahindra Electric Mobility Limited is an Indian automobile
                company that designs and manufactures compact electric vehicles.
                The company adopted its current name after Mahindra acquired
                Reva Electric Car Company in 2010. After the acquisition, the
                company launched the electric hatchback e2o in 2013 in the
                Indian market. Mahindra manufactures electric vehicles in
                different segments - from sedans like eVerito to commercial
                cargo vehicles like eSupro. Recently, Mahindra Electric became
                the first Indian car manufacturer to cross 170 million
                kilometres. Mahindra has yet to announce its roadmap for India;
                however, it has pledged to invest around INR 3000 crores to
                develop electric vehicles.

            <h2>Points of Concern</h2>
            <p>
              We've already compared EVs against conventional vehicles. Now,
              we'll look at the problems concerning the Indian automotive
              industry while also taking locally relevant issues into account.
              These include multiple factors like a supply-demand mismatch and
              uneconomically low volumes, leading to high costs when
              manufacturing EVs. Here's a brief on some of these issues:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Less competition leading to slower growth:</strong> Not
              many automobile manufacturers had entered the EV race. Hence, the
              development of EV technology has been relatively uneventful in the
              last decade.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Low Compatibility with Autonomous Driving Technology:</strong
              >
              Auto analysts say that advanced driver assistance systems on EVs
              will be tough to deploy on crowded Indian streets. Stray animals,
              including cattle, and potholes on the road are a further problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Lack of skilled labour:</strong> EV Technology is still
              evolving, and hence there is a lack of professional workers in the
              country. It also requires engineers to be more proficient in using
              semi-autonomous technologies. Their expertise in dealing with EVs
              is currently in the primitive phase, which will ultimately cause
              inconvenience to the consumer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Issues in the supply chain:</strong> The EV market faces
              problems ensuring an end-to-end supply of components. This sector
              is dependent on importing the battery and power electronics from
              other countries, constituting almost two-thirds of an EV.
              Moreover, there is a lack of standardisation of battery packs,
              compromising quality and different safety standards. Returns don't
              have a definite structure, costing OEMs much money.
            </p>
            <div class="ev-container">
              <img src="assembling.jpg" width="30%" height="20%" />
              <p>
                <strong>Negligible Charging Infrastructure:</strong> Minimum
                requirements to ensure the EV readiness in buildings and parking
                lots and the deployment of publicly accessible chargers on
                highway networks and in cities are also crucial to achieve
                increased EV adoption and boost consumer confidence. According
                to the Ministry of Heavy Industries, the total number of EV
                charging stations installed in India is just over 1000,
                significantly lower than the total number of EVs running in the
                country. Moreover, there are only a few charging stations on
                highways, so running EVs during long-distance journeys will be
                challenging and inconvenient. By 2026, India will need at least
                40,000 public charging points to support the rising number of
                electric vehicles - requiring us to move at an ever-faster rate
                to meet the targets.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <strong>Competition With Economic Upliftment:</strong> 80% of the
              world remains underdeveloped, requiring massive capital expenses
              to uplift people to decent living standards. Capital-intensive
              technologies like EVs are simply not affordable for the majority
              of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Low Mileage:</strong> One of the major drawbacks of owning
              an EV is low mileage. On a single charge, many EVs can only travel
              around 150-200 km, which may not be sufficient for users who
              regularly travel longer distances.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Price of EVs:</strong> Electric vehicles are currently
              expensive compared to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
              vehicles. The initial cost is high, making them less accessible to
              the average consumer.

            <h2>EV Charging Structure in India</h2>
            <p>
              In India, the EV charging infrastructure is developing rapidly but
              still faces several challenges. Key players in the EV charging
              ecosystem include private companies, public sector undertakings
              (PSUs), and government agencies. Companies such as Tata Power,
              Fortum, and ABB are leading the charge in setting up EV charging
              stations across the country. Additionally, state governments are
              also contributing to the growth of this infrastructure by setting
              up charging points and offering incentives for private players.
            </p>
            <p>
              The government has introduced policies and incentives to support
              the development of EV charging infrastructure. The Faster Adoption
              and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme,
              for example, provides financial incentives for the installation of
              EV charging stations. Furthermore, the government is working on
              standardizing the charging infrastructure to ensure compatibility
              and ease of use for consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these efforts, several challenges remain, such as the need
              for more widespread charging infrastructure, issues with
              interoperability, and the need for faster charging technologies.
              Addressing these challenges is crucial for the continued growth of
              the EV market in India.

            <h2>Targeting the Post-Pandemic Vehicle Buyer</h2>
            <p>
              As a part of our market research, we surveyed a closed group of
              people. After examining the results and simultaneously checking
              with the prevailing market conditions, we arrived at the following
              conclusions:
            </p>
            <img src="purplepie.png" width="95%"" height="40%"/>
            <p>
              It was visible that the pandemic caused people to use public
              transit less frequently than before or not at all - fuelled by the
              growing popularity of home delivery services and a work-from-home
              culture. Meanwhile, 29% of new buyers cited lack of cost
              competency as the reason for not choosing EVs over gasoline
              vehicles. The majority of the respondents agreed that they are
              very likely to consider an electric car over traditional vehicles
              if the administration addresses their concerns adequately.
            </p>

            <p>
              We identified three kinds of prospective car buyers: the
              Conventionalist, the Frugalist, and the Innovationist. The
              Conventionalist maintains a neutral attitude towards EVs, citing a
              lack of clarity regarding EVs and the non-availability of proper
              charging infrastructure. They find it difficult to use new
              technology used in EVs. They’re less flexible and are not open to
              changes even after recognizing ecological factors primarily
              because it involves lifestyle changes. Hybrid vehicles appeal to
              this segment, as they come with minor lifestyle changes. If a
              proper support system is available, these users will likely
              consider switching to electric cars.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second type of user, the Frugalist, maintains a mildly
              negative attitude towards EVs, citing high costs and the
              availability of cheap alternative powertrains. However, when
              informed of the long-term advantages of using EVs, they replied
              they were likely to reconsider their decision in about 7-10 years.
            </p>

            <p>The buying preferences can be summarized as follows:</p>
            <img src="userpersona.png" width="95%" height="40%" />
            <p>
              The average cost of a car purchased in the US is $45,000 (~35 lakh
              INR), while the same in India is $10,000 (~7.7 lakh INR). So,
              despite being sold in the US, the EV segment will serve India's
              premium/luxury segment. Data shows that demand is shifting towards
              premium cars and greater capacity.
            </p>
            <img src="linegraph.png" width="95%" height="40%" />
            <p>
              Comparing the total cost of ownership over five years, electric
              cars turn out to be about 10% cheaper than their ICE counterparts.
              They require less frequent maintenance, and the annual maintenance
              costs associated with EVs are 85% lower than ICE cars. All three
              users had expressed concern over the lack of cost parity between
              EVs and combustion engine cars. Therefore, in a price-sensitive
              market like India, it is essential to stress the cost benefits of
              buying an EV and for customers to be made aware of their buying
              choices.
            </p>

            <p>
              EVs are set to enter a new phase where supply-related processes
              and sustainability will be considered critical in the transition
              to clean energy. We shall now discuss various strategies that can
              be adopted to hasten this process at present and beyond, as well
              as existing policies that can be modified to be implemented in
              India.

              accommodating at most two passengers at the same time. The sector
              is expected to make a robust post-pandemic recovery owing to
              strong support from governments worldwide. The industry currently
              finds application in the shared mobility sector and niche areas
              like mail delivery.

              ADAS systems will further expand the market, possibly beyond their
              use in public transport. The advent of computer vision-based
              systems with collision avoidance capabilities will provide safer
              rides, giving micromobility options their long-awaited push to
              grow beyond the current mix. Adopting such models by ride-handling
              services will enable them to offer cheaper end-to-end services to
              everyone and access a significant portion of the market,
              irrespective of their scale of operations.

            <p>
              The uptake of micromobility solutions will vary by region — and
              offering a portfolio that matches local demands is key to success;
              penetration into 70% of the transport sector is achievable in the
              long term.

                <strong>Shared Mobility:</strong> It includes pooled
                ridesharing, e-hailing services, rentals, and taxi services. The
                sector was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to
                double in market size by the end of this decade. Adopting
                small-format models that are perceived safe due to ease of
                maintaining social distancing and fewer points of contact, the
                industry can generate better revenues amid the pandemic causing
                customers to drift away from shared modes of transport. Electric
                two-wheelers and three-wheelers are efficient means of
                transportation for long-distance trips, thereby meeting the
                rising demand for last-mile delivery.

              <strong>eRoaming:</strong> Opening up CPs to all EV drivers
              through roaming agreements between e-mobility service providers
              and charging point operators can result in a more profitable
              business for operators and better capacity utilization. However, a
              uniform interoperability standard is vital for its success.

            <p>
              <strong>Battery Leasing:</strong> Battery leasing solutions will
              enable manufacturers to sell EVs without a battery, and consumers
              can opt to buy or lease EV batteries from an external source.
              Under this model, when buying an EV, it will come with a battery
              leasing arrangement that is prorated depending on the annual
              distance that the driver expects to cover. EV batteries
              deteriorate at about 2% annually — and battery leasing models
              guarantee the condition of battery packs as they are replaced once
              their capacity falls below a certain level (usually at around
              65-70% of the original capacity).
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> This model seems very promising
              for developing countries like India. Companies provide flexible
              options for customers to choose from, and the customer can upgrade
              or downgrade from their existing subscription according to their
              preferences. Other business models like fleet sales or battery
              leasing can also help companies improve profitability.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Direct Sales:</strong> Companies can save up to 25% in
              dealer margins and other incentives by adopting a direct/online
              selling strategy. Although 5% of global sales are made through
              online sales, it is expected that over half of the overall sales
              will be online by 2030.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Customisability</h2>
            <p>
              We’ve seen how important it is to make customers aware of their
              options. Additionally, cost comparability cannot be achieved in
              the sector unless global automakers can believe the Indian EV
              market is bankrollable- and therefore remains a long term target.
              Hence, the customers should get as many variants on the same
              brand- enabling them to choose the one that satisfies their
              requirements. For example, a company can provide two to three
              variants on the same model, differentiated by their driving range.
              There is a precise segmentation of EV buyers based on needs, and
              the companies can cater to each of these segments.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Targeting the right audience</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Communicate Explaining:</strong> The key advantages of EVs
              must be explained and demonstrated in all communication
              opportunities. Experiments are part of the client learning
              process. Everyone should drive to understand the benefits of
              electric vehicles, but many haven't done so yet.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Don't Sell:</strong> Commercials and attractive, detailed
              descriptions are often incompatible. Traditional auto retailers
              are accustomed to commercial forces (incentives, campaigns),
              making it challenging for sales teams to apply this approach
              consistently. The concept of "agent" retailing, alongside the
              "Product Genius" model used by BMWi, seems to be a good option for
              electric vehicles due to the low product competition in this
              market segment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Go Social!</strong> Customer education is a top priority
              in product marketing. Sales consultants should leverage social
              media for easy access to their customer base using text, images,
              and video. Avoid just using branded content — maintain
              conscientiousness while encouraging professionalism.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Emphasise the 'Novelty':</strong> Almost all vehicles are
              great but very similar! Most customers change cars and motorcycles
              without experiencing a fundamentally new product. Electric
              vehicles are new — offering a new sense, new economy, and new
              restrictions. While every innovation has its flaws, the novelty of
              EVs is a significant selling point.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Storyboards:</strong> Invite existing customers worldwide
              to share their own experiences with the company. Every ownership
              experience is unique. When customers from diverse backgrounds
              share what made their car special, it inspires other users and can
              convince prospective buyers to choose an EV over its alternatives.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Referrals:</strong> Referral programs are a tried and
              tested business model that encourages customers to spread the word
              about their cars. In exchange, customers receive a discount on the
              base price of their car or free miles (free charging). A similar
              system could be introduced in India, depending on the availability
              of charging networks.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Short Term Strategies</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>In a world of increasing global competition,</strong> the
              industry needs to have the capacity to innovate and upgrade. A
              targeted approach could achieve critical development in exports of
              product categories where India has a competitive edge. Possible
              collaborations with global suppliers relocating manufacturing
              operations to India could further reinforce these efforts and help
              build new capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Minimise Hidden Costs:</strong> There is a cost parity of
              about $12,000 between electric vehicles and ICE vehicles.
              Categories like real estate, IT, insurance, logistics, packaging,
              etc., are traditionally deprioritised, focusing primarily on
              material cost. However, an exhaustive analysis of various segments
              revealed that OEMs could cut 15 to 25% of total costs.

              <strong>NOTE:</strong> Steel contributes to almost 22% of an
              automaker’s operational costs. Any fluctuation in global steel
              prices has a direct impact on profitability.

              Using straightforward body styling with uncomplicated interior

                <strong>Staying Ahead in Adopting New Technology:</strong>
                Companies should integrate digital analytics and automation into
                their everyday operations. Advanced analytics, process
                digitisation, robotics, and automation could accelerate
                transformations necessary for future evolution. By physically
                integrating various EV components, companies can create more
                efficient thermal management solutions. Also, EV powertrain
                components are usually smaller than their ICE counterparts,
                making room for other systems and multiple options for creating
                new designs. Since most customers are tech-savvy, companies must
                keep up with others in the game and equip their products with
                advanced technology. It is also essential to democratise
                technology by cutting profit margins or pursuing vertical
                integration with partner firms.

            <p>
              <strong>Partnering and Collaborating with Competitors:</strong> A
              struggle for profitability usually accompanies the transition
              towards electrification. As companies have to repurpose their
              tools and platforms for manufacturing electric vehicles,
              collaborating with other manufacturers can ease the burden by
              reducing fixed costs, research and development expenses, and
              achieving total operational efficiency. High-volume procurement of
              raw materials results in better profit margins, which wouldn’t
              have been otherwise possible if companies went alone. There’s a
              tremendous increase in volume over the same base, which can bring
              down costs by up to 15%.
            </p>
            <h2>5. Direct Recycling of EV Batteries</h2>
            <p>
              EVs run without any tailpipe emissions over the course of their
              run, thanks to their batteries. But when these batteries reach the
              end of their life cycle, their benefits fade. These are
              intricately engineered devices, and if they end up in municipal
              waste — 91% of which end up in landfills or get incinerated, they
              can release various toxins, including chances of heavy metal
              toxicity. Even recycling can prove to be a hazardous process.
              Regarding the techniques used for recycling, direct recycling is
              preferred to the widely used recycling processes as it keeps the
              cathode mixture intact.
            </p>
            <img src="batterflow.png" width="95%" height="40%" />
            <p>
              Although direct recycling is focused on single cells and yields
              just tens of grams of cathode powders, it can be adapted for
              large-scale models and become viable in the future.

            <p>
              Virtual Power Plants or VPPs provide an efficient way of utilising
              power from electric vehicles in grid balancing or trading in the
              electricity market (at peak time for energy arbitrage). This
              concept has opened up a new avenue for revenue generation if your
              business is based as fleet operators, bus operators, etc., that
              can play a VPP architecture role. A VPP will require a power
              network integrated with the secure communication network,
              protocols for data sharing and cyber security, etc., to operate,
              which, concerning India, could be possible in a medium to long
              term horizon.

              7. Long Term Solutions: Local EV Assembly and Battery Production
            </h2>
            <div class="ev-container">
              <p>
                Usually referred to as gigafactories, these plants make
                lithium-ion battery cells and provide end-to-end renewable
                energy solutions. They're essential for the foundation that will
                sustain individual industries in the foreseeable future. Despite
                receiving support from the government and being subject to
                industrial push in EV production, international brands are yet
                to announce any plans to set up such plants in the country.
                We’ve identified six areas that provide suitable battery
                production and EV assembly-Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Howrah, Indore,
                Pune and Rourkela. The industry is open to foreign direct
                investment, and this remains the most viable path to export-led
                growth and the establishment of new technology-intensive
                clusters in any country. Moreover, the cost advantage associated
                with local production facilities drives future growth of
                adjacencies — especially in automation, electronics, and energy.

              Companies can save upto two-thirds of costs incurred when electric
              vehicles are fully built in India — which converts to a small gap
              in achieving cost parity between electric vehicles and ICE
              vehicles. However, to facilitate local assembly of electric
              vehicles in India, companies will have to address very immediate
              industrial needs and spend upto $1 billion to set up a local
              manufacturing plant. However, this process can be expedited by
              partnering up with local OEMs with fully functional factories in
              India. The transition will be much smoother — and high volume
              procurement will help both parties save an additional $1,500 per
              $10,000 spent. Moreover, 70% of the components used in EVs are
              same as that of internal combustion engine vehicles. With the
              government offering subsidies up to 50% of project cost, combined
              with cheap labour and raw materials, break-even period can be
              brought down by 4-5 years.

            <h2>Impact and Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
              The adoption of electric vehicles in India has the potential to
              significantly impact the environment and contribute to
              sustainability goals. EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, which
              can help reduce air pollution and improve public health.
              Additionally, the shift towards electric vehicles supports India's
              commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving its
              climate goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the sustainability of electric vehicles also depends on
              the source of electricity used for charging. To maximize the
              environmental benefits, it is essential to focus on increasing the
              use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation.
              Efforts to improve battery recycling and reduce the environmental
              impact of battery production are also crucial for ensuring the
              long-term sustainability of EVs.

            <p><strong>Carbon and Cost</strong></p>

            <p>
              Are EVs truly sustainable? They’re greener than internal
              combustion engines, but the goal of being 100% green might still
              be years away. EVs produce negligible tailpipe emissions, but this
              might not be the case when accounting for the GHG emissions during
              manufacturing and battery charging. Still, electric vehicles
              create a lower carbon footprint over their lifetime compared to
              cars and trucks with traditional engines.
            </p>

            <p>
              In India, the average carbon intensity of electricity generated
              stands at 540 gCO2 per kWh, which is about 14% higher than the
              global average of 475 gCO2 per kWh. This figure does not include
              other GHG emissions, which, if factored in, could lead to a total
              of 600 gCO2e per kWh generated.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, electric vehicles in India generate about 124 gCO2 per
              km. This figure can be reduced by 30% in 2035 and 75% in 2050.
              Achieving these reductions requires decarbonisation in power
              generation, including the phasing down of unabated coal-fired
              power plants and most fossil fuel subsidies. Virtual Power Plants
              will help reduce grid maintenance frequency, which will also
              reflect in net emissions. Efforts to cut down pollution across
              various industries are expected to further reduce the
              environmental impact of EV production.

              Cleaner battery production technologies involving direct recycling
              of used batteries have been suggested to reduce reliance on raw
              materials like manganese and cobalt. Direct recycling has
              generated profits of $7-20 per kWh capacity recycled in countries
              including China, the US, South Korea, and Belgium. However, the
              use of hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling
              techniques has resulted in losses of about $12-24 per capacity

              between FY18 and FY20. The pandemic-induced increase in electronic
              devices is expected to exacerbate this problem. A study by KPMG
              and ASSOCHAM stated that computer equipment accounts for almost
              70% of e-waste in India, followed by telecom (12%), electrical
              equipment (8%), and medical equipment (7%).

              Ninety-five per cent of the e-waste produced in India is recycled
              in the non-formal sector, and 5 per cent of the e-waste volume is
              handled in a standard unit. In and around metropolitan cities in
              India, there are over 3000 units engaged in the non-formal sector
              for e-waste recycling. Non-formal units of e-waste recyclers are
              distributed all over India. Many industries are in Delhi, Tamil
              Nadu, U.P., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Andhra
              Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, etc. Uttar Pradesh, which
              generates 2,02,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of e-waste, has only 22
              functioning units to process 86,130 tonnes of e-waste, which is
              not enough to process half of the e-waste generated by the state.
              Karnataka has 57 ewaste recycling units that can process 44,620
              tonnes of e-waste (1.78 lakh TPA caused). Maharashtra has 32 units
              that can recycle 47,810 tonnes out of 3.96 lakh TPA of e-waste
              generated. Considering the number of e-waste recycling units in
              the country and the e-waste generated, the government needs more
              recycling units. E-waste management laws have been in action in
              India since 2011, mandating that only authorised dismantlers and
              recyclers collect e-waste. E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016, were
              enacted on October 1, 2017. Over 21 electronic products were
              included under this rule. The rule is also applicable to
              components or consumables or parts or spares of Electrical and
              Electronic Equipment (EEE) and related products. The government
              has also strengthened the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
              to ensure the take-back of end-of-life products. A new
              configuration called Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO)
              has been introduced to bolster EPR further.

              Recycling as a business: Recycling is not just a matter of
              recovering recyclable material, it also forms the basis of a
              complete business frontier. Companies can turn the rising demand
              for recycled products into a competitive advantage by getting into
              strategic alliances and profitable partnerships with suppliers,
              distributors and other stakeholders. With governments realising
              the potential of recycling and setting future goals, the industry
              should boom further.

              The electric vehicle market in India is poised for significant
              growth, driven by favorable government policies, technological
              advancements, and increasing consumer awareness. While there are
              challenges to overcome, such as the need for improved charging
              infrastructure and lower EV costs, the overall outlook for the EV
              sector is positive. By addressing these challenges and continuing
              to invest in EV technology and infrastructure, India can achieve
              its goal of becoming a leading player in the global electric
              vehicle market.
