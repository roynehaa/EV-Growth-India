          <h3>Advantages of EVs</h3>
          <p>
            EVs are energy efficient and allow for significant physical
            constraints associated with combustion engine vehicles. An EV has
            only one moving part, i.e., its motor, while traditional cars have
            hundreds of them. Fewer moving parts mean that EVs require less
            periodic maintenance and are more reliable than ICE cars. They don't
            need oil changes or exhaust system repairs. EVs slow down through a
            process called regenerative braking - this results in reduced wear
            and tear on brake pads and rotors while also saving energy. Most
            importantly, EVs are cheaper in the long run and maintain a robust
            fuel-to-cost advantage due to the availability of cheap electricity.
            Also, EVs can provide better aesthetics and drive comfort over
            conventional vehicles.
          </p>

          <h3>Disadvantages of EVs</h3>
          <p>
            The limited range offered by most electric models and the lack of
            proper charging infrastructure creates a sense of ‘range anxiety’ in
            the minds of prospective buyers, possibly driving them away.
            However, EV batteries wear out over time, post which the batteries
            will need to be replaced. They’re heavier and create near-instant
            torque off the line, causing the tires to be replaced 30% more
            frequently than traditional internal combustion engine cars.
          </p>
          <h3>EVs in Corporate Fleet:</h3>
          <p>
            Although EVs have fewer moving parts than combustion engine
            vehicles, our service network doesn't know much about them. The EV
            service network of most OEMs is not yet up to a substantial level
            despite having extensive service and dealer networks across India.
            Automakers will have to reskill their employees before EVs can be
            adopted for commercial use because they will constantly need
            maintenance, servicing, and repair of their vehicles. In the absence
            of a proper service network, there will be disruptions in the supply
            chain.

          <h2>The EV Revolution</h2>
          <div class="ev-container">
            <img src="Group%202.svg" alt="EV Revolution" />
            <p>
              The growth of the internet was disruptive, changing the way we
              almost do anything. And it followed a familiar 'S'-shaped pattern,
              commonly referred to as the sigmoid curve. At the turn of the last
              century, the internal combustion engine followed the same
              trajectory. So did steam engines, video games, and printing
              presses. And electric vehicles will do the same. Presently, EVs
              are just 5% of total car sales, but it shows we're already
              entering the steep part of the S. According to the latest forecast
              by the investment bank UBS, 20% of all new cars sold globally will
              be electric by 2025. That will leap to 40% by 2030, and by 2040
              virtually every new vehicle sold globally will be electric.
              Researchers say that we have already crossed the tipping point,
              and the industry is on a path of exponential growth; reasonably,
              after looking at the sales figures, we couldn’t presume otherwise.

          <h2>Global EV Market and Sales</h2>
          <p>
            Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and overall passenger car sales
            decline, EV car registrations increased in major markets in 2020.
            Governments worldwide spent $14 billion on direct purchase
            incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise
            year on year. Notably, Europe overtook China as the biggest EV
            market due to increased value for money, rising environmental
            concerns, and government-supported incentive schemes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The upward trajectory followed in 2021, with overall sales doubling
            compared to the previous year, with over 6.6 million units sold in
            the past year. This could be attributed to the increased driving
            range of new electric vehicles, with the mean range being about 360
            km, compared to 200 km in 2015. Moreover, buying trends revealed
            that demand is shifting towards premium and higher capacity
            vehicles. The most significant growth is and could continue to be in
            luxury vehicles and SUVs among all categories of passenger vehicles.
            In 2021, the majority of the OEMs updated their product portfolios
            to include electrified SUVs, causing a surge in product sales.
          </p>
          <h4>By region</h4>
          <p>
            China has regained the top position, with a growth of 154% YoY and
            about 3.3 million units in sales. Due to their ultra-affordable
            prices, mini-EVs drove the sales in China, amounting to a quarter of
            the total sales during the first half of 2021, causing the Chinese
            automaker BYD to outpace Tesla in overall market share.
          </p>
          <img src="Group%203.svg" alt="EV market" width="95%" height="40%" />
          <p>
            The US EV market witnessed a growth of over 83% in 2021. Industry
            data reveals that the EV market in Europe has considerably increased
            over the last few years, with annual sales crossing the 2 million
            mark in 2021.
          </p>
          <h4>By company</h4>
          <p>
            Tesla led the global EV sales with a market share of 14.55% in the
            first half of 2021, with sales amounting to 421,000 units.
            Volkswagen followed this with 12.52%, General Motors (including
            SAIC-GM-Wuling) with 12.2%, and Stellantis with 6.45%. Due to their
            ultra-affordable prices, Mini-EVs drove the sales in China,
            amounting to a quarter of the total sales during H1 2021 - causing a
            two-fold increase in the Chinese giant BYD’s sales. Significantly,
            some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only
            electric vehicles, with targets set for 2030 and beyond in most
            cases. And it’s not just the premium brands.

          <p>
            The world’s most valuable automaker, Tesla, forecast its deliveries
            to grow by 50% YoY. The company is working to achieve full
            self-driving by the end of 2022. The company’s upcoming AI
            supercomputer, DOJO, will continuously train and improve its full
            self-driving software on its own.

            <b class="highlight">The Tesla Story:</b>Since going public in July
            2010, Tesla has been on top of alternative powertrains in the
            passenger vehicle industry. Valued at $925 billion, three times that
            of Toyota, its research and development expenses reflect the brand's
            commitment to innovation. While the United States continues to be
            Tesla's most important target market, the company aims to tap into
            the Chinese and European markets, as well. With a growth rate of
            over 157 per cent in 2021, Tesla is one of the fastest-growing
            brands worldwide. Most of its models are electric passenger cars,
            particularly sedans and crossover vehicles, but plans to release its
            first electric light-duty truck in 2023 are underway. Direct sales,
            home services, and the supercharger network make Tesla cars the

            The ID.4, launched as a rival to Tesla’s Model Y, has a very
            appealing design and is a first in many aspects. First of all, it
            boasts of a battery that has a claimed per-charge range of 520 km.
            The car has a 210 mm ground clearance, and VW is betting big on its
            off-road capabilities. Initial reviewers reported that the vehicle
            offered a marginally better ride quality and comfort than the Model
            Y. Most importantly, ID.4 is $20,000 cheaper than Model Y. Amid
            shifts in nsumer preference, VW continues to change its lineup
            towards electric vehicles especially eSUVs.

        <section id="ev-charging-dilemma">
          <h2>Solving the EV Charging Dilemma</h2>
          <p>
            Consumers who consider buying their first EV have many anxieties -
            wondering if they might get stuck on the highway if there are not
            enough charging points. While many EV drivers use privately-funded
            chargers at home or work, about half of the charging will come from
            chargers on the road and at destinations, depending on the region.
            So, without a public charging infrastructure, the adoption of
            electric vehicles will continue slowly.
          </p>
          <img src="Group%206.svg" alt="EV market" width="95%" height="40%" />
          <p>
            The government must work with players across the EV ecosystem to
            create a ramp-up master plan, including location, time, type, and
            the number of charging points. They should communicate the plan's
            goals to all stakeholders as clearly as possible. And the creation
            of key players should be encouraged until the private sector is
            ready to intervene. They were less profitable but necessary,
            especially along highways or in sparsely populated areas. Only then
            can the dilemma of creating conditions for private investment and
            creating a self-sufficient market structure that is economically
            viable without subsidies be resolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many consumers are hesitant to buy an electric vehicle until they
            know they can charge it when and where they want it. A global survey
            of licensed drivers found that 46% of respondents said they would
            only buy an electric vehicle if charging stations were as common as
            gas stations. Most charging points are slow devices installed where
            the owner is away from the car for a long time - for example, homes,
            offices, shopping malls, and commercial buildings. But checkpoints
            along highways, short-term parking lots, and checkpoints in rural
            areas where drivers can stop en-route to recharge their cars should
            be faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government's response to this problem has been by launching
            public funding markets for charging infrastructure. But in general,
            they did it without any plans to expand the market, and it was left
            to the open market to decide. The results of these initial efforts
            were often confusing. For example, in the early days of the Berlin
            program (2010-2015), the government provided various subsidies to
            develop charging infrastructure. Still, the existing EV charging
            stations were not fully utilised because appropriate regulations or
            requirements were not set. It is not commercially viable.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the United States, competing standards have prevented many CPs
            from servicing more than one type of vehicle. As a result, the
            driver arrives at the checkpoint they find on the map but finds it
            unavailable, a situation that undermines confidence in the EV
            charging process. Governments must develop a national master plan
            for EV charging infrastructure and economics that supports the EV
            ecosystem, has the proper framework for public-private partnerships
            and ensures that the private sector is an attractive sector worthy
            of participation. All CP locations should be pre-mapped, considering
            the mix, distribution, and use of different types of sites where
            people can charge their vehicles. For example, a government may
            place a fast charger every 50 miles on a highway and a charger in
            each zone of a specific size, such as every 50 square miles. It is
            also essential for the government to provide comprehensive and
            convenient charging access for low- and middle-income users who
            cannot easily upgrade their homes to charge their electric vehicles.
          </p>
          <p>
            A governance body should be established so that the first
            stakeholders (municipalities and government agencies such as the
            Ministry of Energy, Transportation, Technology, and Environment) and
            other ecosystem participants can coordinate and agree on how to
            proceed. This governing body must define an EV charging ecosystem
            that will ultimately include a variety of players such as OEMs,
            utilities, charging professionals (providing access cards, apps,
            payments, and user experiences), investors, entrepreneurs, and NGOs.
            Many of these participants need a business case, including grants,
            incentives, and other government-backed guarantees to move forward.
            Others are relevant at a basic level. For example, governments
            should engage grid operators to facilitate the connectivity of
            electric vehicle charging infrastructure by choosing less
            constrained grid locations. For instance, in the Netherlands in
            2009, six grid operators established the Elaad foundation to install
            electric vehicle charging infrastructure in cooperation with
            municipalities. Now, let’s dive into the leadership stories of two
            European nations, Norway and the Netherlands.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="netherlands-ev-dream">
          <h2>How did the Netherlands achieve its EV dream?</h2>
          <p>
            In the Netherlands, around three in every five of the 400,000 new
            cars sold annually are PHEVs. One of the main reasons that can be
            attributed to it is the network of some 75,000 charging stations –
            which accounts for nearly a third of the entire EU total. Besides
            that, the Dutch have their own charging points at home, accounting
            for almost 190,000. In towns, every electric car user has the right
            to access charging stations within 200 meters of their home, and in
            the countryside, motorists have their own posts. Around 75% of the
            generating electricity is rendered by solar power.
          </p>
          <img src="Group%205.svg" alt="EV market" width="95%" height="40%" />
          <p>
            Also, the government incentivises the ownership process to promote
            EV growth in the country. The owner can claim up to €4,000 on buying
            a new car. Now let's move on to the question, "How easy is it to
            claim in the Netherlands?" The answer is straightforward. Roaming
            protocols adopted more than a decade ago allow multiple operators in
            the market to take advantage of roaming opportunities. This way,
            drivers can top up anywhere with one card or app instead of the
            various cards required in different countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, the deployment of slow charging has traditionally started in
            supermarkets, parking lots, or shopping malls. But over time,
            municipalities began to intervene, adding to the network when
            electric vehicle drivers requested a charging station near their
            address to charge on the road. This is an essential benefit for
            apartment occupants who are reluctant to purchase electric vehicles
            because there is no place to charge them. Many operators are on the
            market, such as MisterGreen, Shell, FastNed, or Allego.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, the Netherlands shows that financial incentives can be
            decisive for adopting electric vehicles. Still, despite the lack of
            many stimuli at present, the number of available charging stations
            and having no worries about charging creates a positive impact. This
            allows the Netherlands to remain a leader in electric vehicle
            adoption despite lower incentives.

          <h2>Cost Comparability of EVs in Norway</h2>
          <p>
            EVs made up almost two-thirds of Norway’s overall sales in 2021,
            making it the country with the highest proportion of electric
            vehicles among all other nations. Industry representatives expect
            sales to grow to as much as 80% of the overall market in 2022. The
            country is the only one in the world in the third stage of a
            disruptive trend, and further growth of EVs in the country is
            inevitable.

            This high uptake is a testament to the progressive electric vehicle
            policies implemented by the government over the past several years.
            The acceleration was mainly caused by the vehicles becoming cheaper
            as Norway exempted fully electric cars from taxes imposed on those
            relying on fossil fuels - owners benefited from waivers on
            purchase/import taxes, annual road tax, and exemption from 25% VAT.
            EV owners needed to pay only half of the fee levied for using
            ferries and municipal parking. Conversely, it raised taxes on
            traditional combustion engine cars, including high incompliance fees
            incorporating carbon tax, NOX tax, and scrapping fees. Also, because
            Norway is a small country, people don't need to drive long distances
            in most cases. On top of these, the Norwegian Parliament recently
            declared its new zero-emission target, requiring all new cars sold
            by 2025 to be electric (or hydrogen).
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, renewable electricity is key to successfully decarbonising
            transport systems. Norway, being a pioneer in offshore wind systems
            and hydropower, couldn't have achieved this in any better way. All
            of this combined has caught the attention of many multinational
            corporations, which has resulted in Norway being at the forefront of
            EV technology development. Companies are also planning to start
            battery swapping stations in the country.

            Solid-State Battery: The future of battery technology A solid-state
            battery uses solid electrolytes, unlike liquid solutions used in
            Li-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries risk getting damaged under
            external force or high amounts of stress, while solid-state
            batteries have improved stability as they maintain form even after
            getting damaged. Although solid-state batteries for usage in
            electric vehicles are still in the early stages of development, the
            initial results are promising. The solid-state battery market will
            expand at a CAGR of over 30%, growing over 13 times from 2021 to
            2031.

            <b>Enhancing Battery Performance Using Nanotechnology</b><br />
            The main problems EVs face are due to their batteries, as they are
            very costly and have a short charging life. We have to overcome this
            difficulty, adopting some applications of nanotechnology, which has
            produced some great results in the past few years.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Lithium-ion batteries, the Lithium is inserted into the cathode.
            During cell charging, the cathode material releases Li-ions to the
            electrolyte. Electrons are removed from the cathode by an external
            field and transferred to the anode. The charge-compensating Li-ions
            are attracted by the negative electrode and then inserted. During
            cell discharge, the reverse reaction occurs. Now, suppose we use
            carbon nanomaterials instead of micrometre-sized particles. In that
            case, the efficiency and capacity of the battery will improve. Also,
            the diffusion rate will decrease, resulting in current density
            increment in electrode and mobility, conductivity will also
            increase. This will result in electrochemical reactions working more
            efficiently, undoubtedly increasing the battery's efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of Nanotubes, we can also use nanowires made up of titanium
            oxide (TiO2) or zinc oxide(ZnO). Still, some of these materials are
            in the early stages of their commercial manufacturing, but some are
            readily available. However, these all are neither safe nor
            cost-effective. But it can improve battery efficiency by increasing
            their intercalation capacity.
